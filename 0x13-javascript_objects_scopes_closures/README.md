# Project: 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description

This project covers fundamental concepts in JavaScript, including objects, scopes, and closures. The tasks involve creating and manipulating classes to understand the principles of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- Learn how to create an object in JavaScript.
- Grasp the meaning of `this` in JavaScript.
- Understand what `undefined` means.
- Recognize why variable type and scope are important.
- Comprehend the concept of closures in JavaScript.
- Understand what a prototype is.
- Learn how to inherit an object from another.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory.
- Code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also, as reference: AirBnB style.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.

### Installation and Dependencies

- Install Node 14:
  ```bash
  $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
  $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```
- Install semistandard:
  ```bash
  $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
  ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of JavaScript. Below is an overview of the tasks:

### Task 0: Rectangle #0

- File: `0-rectangle.js`
- Description: Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### Task 1: Rectangle #1

- File: `1-rectangle.js`
- Description: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle, taking width and height as arguments in the constructor.

### Task 2: Rectangle #2

- File: `2-rectangle.js`
- Description: Enhance the `Rectangle` class from Task 1 to handle cases where width or height is 0 or not a positive integer.

### Task 3: Rectangle #3

- File: `3-rectangle.js`
- Description: Extend the `Rectangle` class to include an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

### Task 4: Rectangle #4

- File: `4-rectangle.js`
- Description: Expand the `Rectangle` class to include additional instance methods: `rotate()` and `double()`.

### Task 5: Square #0

- File: `5-square.js`
- Description: Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from the `Rectangle` class.

### Task 6: Square #1

- File: `6-square.js`
- Description: Extend the `Square` class from Task 5 to include an instance method `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`.

### Task 7: Occurrences

- File: `7-occurrences.js`
- Description: Write a function `nbOccurences` that returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a list.

### Task 8: Esrever

- File: `8-esrever.js`
- Description: Write a function `esrever` that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in `reverse` method.

### Task 9: Log me

- File: `9-logme.js`
- Description: Write a function `logMe` that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### Task 10: Number conversion

- File: `10-converter.js`
- Description: Write a function `converter` that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.
